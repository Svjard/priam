Priam is an Apache Cassandra 3.x+ based ORM with full ES6 support. It is a fork of Alexandar Wong's original work with [dakota-cassandra](https://github.com/ahlwong/dakota-cassandra) but moved entirely into ES6 with extendable Models and Apache Cassandra 3.x+ support.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install priam
```
